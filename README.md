## **Stargate: ReLeveled is a continuation of the [Original Stargate: Leveled by Telemort/tehgreatdoge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/stargate-leveled)**
This pack is an updated progression based modpack built around Botany Pots and a custom tiered circuit system. The pack uses progressive quests to help show current objectives, as well as to guide players through individual mods. For exploration mods, Ad Astra and Stargate Journey are provided, as they complement each other well to create an exciting space exploration experience. The pack also comes with an easy mode (accessible via **/easymode** in-game) that makes certain parts of the progression easier and more beginner-friendly.
### **Features include:**
- Tiered Botany Pot Growing
- Two Eras of Automation
- A Balanced Quest Book
- Three Circuit Tiers
- Many custom recipes to help with Automation
- Public Server already listed! Join us!
